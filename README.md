# Logalyzer - a log analyzer

The aim of this project is to create a distributed application to analyze logs and produce different statisctics
from it using Map Reduce.

We implement map reduce using Apache hadoop, a framework for distributed processing of large datasets that also provides
an implementation of the Map  Reduce framework.


Please find further explanation of the implementation in the docs folder and the video documentation in this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AooxyMQtPd8.
